This is a class project for Relational Database Management, where we try to build a **School Management System**.
________________________________________________
## Project Description
We intend to design a database to maintain information about school staffs and students, including both an Enrollment System and a Financial System. Through this management system, departments could schedule classes, students could get enrolled, instructors could assign grades, and tuition fees and salaries could be paid. Moreover, specific rules regarding enrollment and accounting are observed to make the system effective and efficient.
